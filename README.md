# Netflix-movies_analysis-project
A quick project of exploration of Netflix movie data and performing exploratory data analysis for a production company.

Jupyter Notebook for analyzing Netflix data from 1990s.  
Includes duration analysis, genre filtering (e.g., Action), and bar chart visualization.

The goal was to analyse data to answer on these questions:
- What was the most frequent movie duration in the 1990s? Save an approximate answer as an integer called duration (use 1990 as the decade's start year).
- A movie is considered short if it is less than 90 minutes. Count the number of short action movies released in the 1990s and save this integer as short_movie_count.
